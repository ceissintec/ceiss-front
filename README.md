### ESLint setup

This project uses ESLint. We recommend/require:

- Don't install ESLint globally.If there's an extension for your code editor, use it.
- Install these packages: `eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-config-prettier prettier` as dev dependencies.
- Be sure your .eslintrc file is exactly the same as ours. It has the rules we enforce for the project.
